# Phase 4: Parallelism Verification System

## 🎯 Purpose

This verification system **empirically proves** whether the M3-Swarm threading implementation provides true parallelism or false parallelism (asyncio).

**Critical Question:** Are 24 bots **truly running in parallel** on multiple CPU cores, or sequentially on one thread?

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Full Verification

```bash
make verify-parallel
```

This runs all 5 verification gates and generates a signed evidence bundle.

### Run Quick Check

```bash
make quick
```

Runs Gates 1 & 2 only (code audit + concurrency proof). Fast way to verify parallelism.

---

## 🔬 The 5 Verification Gates

### Gate 1: Code Audit ✅
**Verifies:** Code uses threading, not asyncio

**Method:** 
- Count lines with `async def`, `await`, `asyncio` (asyncio code)
- Count lines with `threading.Thread`, `concurrent.futures` (threading code)
- Check `bot_agent.py` and `swarm_manager.py` for threading imports

**Pass Criteria:**
- Threading lines > Asyncio lines
- `bot_agent.py` contains `threading.Thread`
- `swarm_manager.py` contains `threading.Thread`

**Run individually:**
```bash
python3 verify_code_audit.py
```

---

### Gate 2: Concurrency Proof Test 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Verifies:** True parallel execution (not sequential asyncio)

**Method:**
- Spawn 4 bots
- Give each bot a 2-second **CPU-bound** task (not I/O)
- Measure wall-clock time from start to completion

**Theory:**
- **TRUE parallelism**: Tasks run simultaneously → ~2 seconds
- **FALSE parallelism** (asyncio): Tasks run sequentially → ~8 seconds

**Pass Criteria:** < 3 seconds

**This is the definitive test.** Cannot be faked.

**Run individually:**
```bash
python3 verify_concurrency_proof.py
```

---

### Gate 3: Thread Count Verification ✅
**Verifies:** Thread count matches bot count

**Method:**
- Spawn 24 bots
- Sample `threading.active_count()` every second for 30 seconds
- Calculate average thread count

**Expected:**
- Asyncio: 1-2 threads
- Threading: 24+ threads (one per bot)

**Pass Criteria:** Average thread count >= 24

**Run individually:**
```bash
python3 verify_thread_count.py
```

---

### Gate 4: CPU Core Utilization ✅
**Verifies:** Multiple CPU cores are utilized

**Method:**
- Spawn 24 bots with active tasks
- Sample per-core CPU usage every second for 60 seconds
- Count cores with >20% average utilization

**Expected:**
- Asyncio: ~6 cores (Ollama workers only)
- Threading: 10-14 cores (all performance cores)

**Pass Criteria:** >= 8 cores with high utilization

**Run individually:**
```bash
python3 verify_cpu_cores.py
```

---

### Gate 5: Baseline Comparison ✅
**Verifies:** Threading outperforms asyncio

**Method:**
- Compare Gate 1-4 results
- Verify threading shows improvements over asyncio baseline

**Pass Criteria:** At least 3 improvements verified

**Run individually:**
```bash
python3 verify_baseline_comparison.py
```

---

## 📦 Verification Bundle

After all gates complete, a signed verification bundle is generated:

```
.checkpoints/PHASE4_VERIFICATION_BUNDLE.json
```

**Contents:**
- All 5 gate results
- Pass/fail status for each gate
- Overall verdict (VERIFIED / MINIMAL / FAILED)
- SHA256 cryptographic signature
- System information
- Git commit hash
- Timestamp

**Verdicts:**
- **VERIFIED (FULL):** All critical gates + 4+ gates passed
- **VERIFIED (PARTIAL):** Critical gates + 3+ gates passed
- **MINIMAL:** Critical gates passed only
- **FAILED:** Critical gate 2 failed (no true parallelism)

---

## 🔑 Critical Success Criteria

**MUST PASS:**
- **Gate 2:** Concurrency proof < 3 seconds

**This single test proves true parallelism.**

If Gate 2 fails (>= 3 seconds), the system is using asyncio sequential execution, not threading parallelism. No amount of success in other gates can compensate.

---

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Gate 2: Concurrency Proof Results

| Time | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| < 2.5s | ✅ Excellent - True parallelism |
| 2.5-3.0s | ✅ Good - Parallelism verified |
| 3.0-5.0s | ⚠️ Partial - Some parallelism, bottleneck exists |
| > 5.0s | ❌ Failed - Sequential execution (asyncio) |

### Example Output

**TRUE Parallelism (Threading):**
```
4 bots × 2s tasks
Elapsed: 2.1 seconds
✅ TRUE PARALLELISM VERIFIED
```

**FALSE Parallelism (Asyncio):**
```
4 bots × 2s tasks
Elapsed: 8.3 seconds
❌ FALSE PARALLELISM - Sequential execution
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Gate 2 Fails (> 3 seconds)

**Diagnosis:** System is using asyncio, not threading

**Fix:**
1. Check if `core/bot_agent.py` uses `async def` (asyncio)
2. Should use `threading.Thread` instead
3. Run emergency migration: `EMERGENCY_PARALLELISM_FIX.yaml`

### Only 6 Cores Active (Gate 4)

**Diagnosis:** Ollama bottleneck, not Python thread issue

**Fix:**
```bash
export OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=10  # Increase from 6
ollama serve
```

Re-run Gate 4.

### Thread Count Low (Gate 3)

**Diagnosis:** Threads not spawning correctly

**Fix:**
1. Check `SwarmManager.spawn_swarm()` implementation
2. Verify each bot creates a `threading.Thread`
3. Check for thread crashes

## 🤖 For AI Agents

**Command to run:**
```bash
make verify-parallel
```

**Success criteria:**
- Gate 2 MUST pass (< 3 seconds)
- At least 4 of 5 gates pass
- Bundle verdict: VERIFIED

**If Gate 2 fails:**
- ABORT immediately
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 5
- Implementation is NOT using true parallelism
- Run `EMERGENCY_PARALLELISM_FIX.yaml` migration

**Validation discipline:**
- Cannot skip verification
- Cannot fake results (tests are empirical)
- Bundle must be signed
- Results are reproducible

---

## 📝 Manual Verification

To manually verify parallelism without the full test suite:

```python
import time
import concurrent.futures

def cpu_task():
    result = 0
    start = time.time()
    while time.time() - start < 2:
        for i in range(10000):
            result += i ** 2
    return result

# Test
start = time.time()
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(cpu_task) for _ in range(4)]
    for f in futures:
        f.result()
elapsed = time.time() - start

print(f"4 × 2s tasks took {elapsed:.2f}s")
print("TRUE parallel" if elapsed < 3 else "FALSE parallel")
```

Expected: < 3 seconds for true parallelism.
